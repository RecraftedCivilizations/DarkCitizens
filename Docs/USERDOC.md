# DarkCitizens

## What am I playing?
DarkRP is a game mode in Garry's Mod. It lets players join the server, become a citizen of a fictional city and take a job. Jobs are typically the following:


- Mayor: Decides the laws of the city and sets taxes for jobs. Upon death, an election is triggered for the job of Mayor. Players can pay $XXX to take part in the election.
- Police officer/Government jobs: Protects the city from criminals. Can raid peoples properties if found doing illegal activity and arrest people, sending them to jail.
- Mobster: Illegally prints money, can mug people, can raid rival mobsters, can kill the mayor if the laws are too much/taxes are too high, rob the bank.
- Doctor: Heals people for money
- Baker: Can spawn in a bakery factory and cook bread to sell
- Miner: Can mine ores and sell them for money


Money is the essential part of the game. This is the main way of progressing. Money can be used to buy weapons/armour. Weapons are expensive as they are illegal and most of the money making activities are illegal, which makes it very enticing to break the law, resulting in skirmishes with the police, giving players a reason to invest in guns.
> Note: These points may differ from server to server, but the main
> concepts will probably be preserved

## Okay so how do I play?
In DarkRp you will join a job and fulfill different tasks 
to gain money and experience.

### Jobs
To join your first job open the job menu by typing
`/jobs` into the chat. An inventory GUI will open presenting you
with different options, these jobs are different from server to server
as well as the Xp and money gain from them. Hover over a job icon
to see requirements, the description and of course most importantly the money and xp
rewards. To join a certain job you may have to be a certain level.

### Job loss
Maybe you are tired of your current job, or the city just doesn't want you in the job you are
currently in. To leave a job you can just press another job icon to join the next one or click
you original job icon to directly leave it. But maybe you don't want to leave your job,
maybe you are a high ranking official who is comfortably earning money on the peoples' behalf.
There is just one problem the people don't like you, some jobs may kick you out if you die
so watch your steps. And the last possibility, some high ranking government member doesn't want you
in your job anymore, maybe you didn't complete you duties, or they just hate you. In this case 
they may demote you from your job.

### Demoting
So you decided to demote one of your workers huh? Nothing easier than that, type `/demote` followed
by the players name to kick him directly from the job or type `/demote` and the jobs name
to open a menu where you can see all your vassals and demote them by  a simple click on them.

### Groups
Every job is part of a certain group, while progressing in the game you will gain
xp that is assigned to each group according to the job you are currently in. You will be
notified when you gain xp or level up in a group. The max level for each group is set by the server admin
as well as the xp thresholds you have to reach to level up.  
Each group may have modifiers set that will determine if you can be arrested by the police or hurt other players
in the same group.

### XP and Money gain
So now you joined a job, and you are ready to work your way up into the upper class, but
wait, how to gain money and xp?  
The first and probably the easiest way is to just stay around and do nothing, you heard right,
there is a basic money and xp gain, how often and how much you gain is defined by the admins.
But of course that is not the only way, by typing `/tasks` you open the tasks' menu, these tasks
can be completed for additional money and/or xp gain. And as in every good economy you can
of course trade with your friends and enemy's.

### Tasks
As I said earlier you can open the task menu by typing `/tasks`. After opening the menu you may
inspect a task and what to do closer by clicking the specific task. This will open the actions'
menu where each step to completing the task is defined. When you completed every action in a task
the task will be marked as fulfilled and the xp and money amount will be transferred to you.

### Actions
Each task is a mixture of different actions you have to complete to get the rewards, to see what tasks
you have to fulfil and how to do it type `/tasks` and then click the tasks' icon you want to know
the actions off, by hovering above a specific action you may see the requirements to fulfil the action
and your current progress.

### Government
As in every city there will most likely be some kind of official head who has to set laws
define taxes and yes, govern. This head of the city will probably be elected. After the election
the elected player will gain access to set laws and taxes.

### Elections
Some jobs may be elected(e.g. the mayor), to join these jobs you have to fulfil all requirements(e.g Group lvls), now
to trigger a new election just click on the job icon, and a message will announce that a new election just started.
The partaking may cost some money. Now after some time another message will appear that the vote phase has 
started until then, every other player who fulfills the requirements may candidate for the same job.
After you saw the message type `/elections`, this will open a menu showing all current elecection, by clicking
on a specific election you will see all current members and be able to vote. You simply vote by
clicking on the player head you want to vote for.
> Note: Voting may cost money

After the election finished the player who won will be announced and join the job he got
elected for, leaving his old job.
If you leave your elected job, doesn't matter which way, take a look at [Job Loss](./USERDOC.md#Job loss), a new election
will be triggered and a new worker will be elected.

### Laws
To see all current laws type `/laws` and a book will open showing all laws

### Create new laws
If you want to pass a new law you have to be in a job that is tagged mayor, if you are
type `/createLaw` followed by the law title, and a detailed description of you law.
> Note: If your title is longer then one word use `"Your title here"` to make sure it is displayed as one piece

### Remove laws
To remove a law you have to be, of course, a mayor, by typing `/removeLaw` followed by the laws title
you will remove it from the law book.

### Set taxes
Your people are too rich? They make a lot of money, but you can't do anything with that? Here is the solution
use the command "/setTaxes" followed by the percentage that you want you peoples to get taxed by.
> E.G. `/setTaxes 50` to take 50% from their income as tax

All the tax money will be transferred to the CITYBANK account.
